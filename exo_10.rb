# We can retrieve the current time using 'time.now.year'
# '(birth_year..current_year)' is a range that is iterated through each year. If we use ('..') it creates an INCLUSIVE RANGE starting at the first integer and ending at the last. '(...)' is a range that excludes the final value. I selected the EXCLUSIVE one because the text should be in the present tense for 2023.
#  |year| is a block variable used in the 'each' method. During each iteration, the current value is assigned to the block variable year, which represents a specific year within the range.
